<b> Recalling Checked Out Items</b>
<PRE>

RECALLING CHECKED OUT ITEMS
All patrons are entitled to use checked out items for 21 days unless they
have been recalled for use at the Reserve Desk.

Items currently checked out with a due date more than 21 days in the future
are checked out to faculty, graduate students, or are on Interlibrary Loan.
These items may be recalled after the current patron has had them for 21
days.  Take the information about the item you wish to "recall" to any
circulation desk.  A "hold" will be placed for you, the due date adjusted
accordingly, and a notice sent to the person with the material indicating
that another person would like to use the item.

A "hold" may be placed on items due in less than 21 days.  After the item
has been returned and checked in, a notice will be generated and mailed to
you indicating that the item is available for pickup.
