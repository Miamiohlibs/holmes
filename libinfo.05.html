<PRE>
If you do not find a desired item, it may be obtained through
Interlibrary Loan.  Go to the Reference Desk to initiate a request.
This service is available to all Miami Faculty, Staff and Students
and usually takes at least two weeks, depending on the nature of the
items and the lending institution.
